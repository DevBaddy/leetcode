![leetcode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27ddf194-43f5-49dd-a4b6-d50504d3dfe8)

## Inspiration

I wanted to enhance my problem-solving skills through the problem-solving platform named LeetCode. I want to maintain a frequency of solving one LeetCode problem per week.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge was, and still is, thinking of very efficient solutions for complex problems.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to break down problems into smaller chunks and solve those smaller pieces to tackle the big problem.

## The Repository

This repository contains all of the LeetCode challenges I have completed. I have covered LeetCode challenges in three languages: JavaScript, Python, and C++. C++ is the main language I use to solve LeetCode problems in order to learn the language better.
